    <h1>Craniosacral Therapy Course</h1>
    
    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our comprehensive 3-day certification course in Craniosacral Therapy (CST). This intensive program combines detailed anatomical study with hands-on practice to develop the subtle palpation skills needed for effective craniosacral therapy. Participants will learn to assess and treat the craniosacral system through gentle, non-invasive techniques.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This course is designed for licensed healthcare professionals, including massage therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, nurses, and physicians. Strong foundation in anatomy and physiology, particularly of the nervous system, is required.</p>
