        <p>Empowering Migrant Families in Nepal's Kathmandu District</p>
    </div>

    <div class="vision-statement">
        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>Project Possible aims to empower, support, and educate migrant families through three main initiatives within the Kathmandu district. We are committed to engaging with migrant families to offer targeted and responsive support, working together to create a brighter future for Nepalese children and their communities.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Nepal's Internal Migration</h2>
        <p>Internal migration in Nepal represents a complex socio-economic phenomenon driven by various factors:</p>
        
        <div class="cultural-note">
            <h3>Who Are the Migrants?</h3>
            <p>The migrants from Bajura and Kalikot primarily consist of farming families belonging to marginalized communities, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional agricultural workers seeking better opportunities</li>
                <li>Families affected by climate change and declining agricultural yields in their home regions</li>
                <li>Communities historically excluded from economic development</li>
                <li>Multi-generational families moving together to maintain cultural bonds</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="importance-box">
            <h3>Push Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited agricultural opportunities in mountainous regions</li>
                <li>Lack of educational infrastructure in remote areas</li>
                <li>Limited access to healthcare services</li>
                <li>Climate change impacts on traditional farming methods</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reference">
            <p>According to the Nepal Labor Force Survey 2023/24, internal migration has increased by 15% in the past five years, with the majority of movements being from far-western regions to urban centers.</p>

        <h2>Regional Context</h2>
        <p>Recent data from the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation (MoLMCPA) in 2024 highlights the critical needs of our target communities:</p>

        <div class="importance-box">
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Education is crucial for breaking the cycle of poverty in migrant communities. Research shows that children of migrants face unique challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>70% of migrant children in Kathmandu face educational disruption during transition</li>
                <li>Lack of proper school supplies leads to decreased attendance and participation</li>
                <li>Language barriers affect academic performance and social integration</li>

        <h3>Program Overview</h3>
        <p>Working in partnership with the Nepalese Government's funded education program, we provide essential support to ensure children can fully participate in their education journey.</p>

                <h4>Annual Resource Distribution</h4>
                <p>Supporting 100 children with essential educational materials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>School uniforms - ensuring equal participation and dignity</li>

                <li>Only 24% of women in migrant communities have regular access to feminine hygiene products</li>
                <li>Cervical cancer rates are 3x higher in communities without regular screening</li>
                <li>Cultural barriers often prevent women from seeking preventive care</li>

        </div>

        <div class="cultural-note">
            <h3>Cultural Context</h3>
            <p>In many Nepalese communities, menstruation remains a taboo subject. Traditional practices like Chhaupadi, though legally banned, still impact women's health decisions. Our program works within cultural sensitivities while promoting health and dignity.</p>
