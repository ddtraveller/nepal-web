how to send file github to nepal web page

Could you clarify what you mean by “send file GitHub to Nepal web page”? Here are a few interpretations — let me know which one fits, or feel free to clarify:

1. You have a file on GitHub and want to show it on a web page hosted in Nepal
If your goal is to display or use a file (like a PDF, image, or code file) from a GitHub repository on a website:

If it's a static file (like an image, PDF, or HTML file):

Upload the file to your GitHub repo.

Go to the file in GitHub and click the "Raw" button.

Copy the URL and use it in your webpage like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/path/to/file.jpg">
or

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/path/to/file.pdf" target="_blank">View File</a>
If it’s a webpage hosted on GitHub Pages, you can link to that:

GitHub Pages URL format is usually:

https://username.github.io/repo-name/
You can link that from your Nepal web page or embed parts of it using <iframe> if needed.

2. You want to upload a file from GitHub to a Nepal-hosted website/server
If you have access to a server (e.g., cPanel, FTP, or SSH access), you can:

Manually download the file from GitHub and upload it to your server.

Use Git on your server (if available):

git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
That will copy the whole repo. Or, use wget or curl to download a single file from the raw URL.

3. You want to integrate or sync a GitHub repo with a website hosted in Nepal
You can automate this with:

A webhook

A deployment script

GitHub Actions to push changes via FTP or SSH to your server.

Let me know exactly what you're trying to do (e.g., file type, website platform, access level), and I’ll walk you through it step by step.
