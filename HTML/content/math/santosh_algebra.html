<p>Holi is a vibrant and joyful festival celebrated primarily in India and Nepal, but it has gained popularity worldwide. Known as the Festival of Colors, it marks the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. Holi typically falls in March, on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna.

The celebration involves people coming together in communities, playing with colored powders (called gulal), singing, dancing, and enjoying festive foods. The colors are thrown freely in the air and at one another, creating a lively and colorful atmosphere. The colors represent the diversity of life and the beauty of spring.

Holi is also associated with various mythological stories, particularly the legend of Prahlad and the demoness Holika. It symbolizes the triumph of devotion and faith over evil.

Families and friends come together for Holi, sharing sweets like gujiya, and exchanging greetings of joy and happiness. The festival fosters unity and breaks down social barriers, with people of all ages and backgrounds participating in the celebrations. Holi is not only a time for revelry but also a spiritual occasion for many, who mark it by offering prayers for good health and prosperity.

The energy, color, music, and fun make Holi a memorable and heartwarming festival.
