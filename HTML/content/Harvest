Traditional Harvesting Process
Manual labor is the norm – people use khurpis (small hand hoes) or kodalos (pickaxes) to gently dig up the soil.

Families and neighbors often help each other—harvesting is a communal activity.

After digging, potatoes are gathered, sorted by size, and dried in the sun for a day or two before storage.

Potatoes are stored in cool, dark spaces—sometimes in mud-plastered storage pits or barns to last through winter.

📍 Key Potato-Growing Regions
Solukhumbu

Rukum

Jumla (famous for its organic mountain potatoes!)

Kalikot

Terai areas also grow potatoes, but with more mechanization in places like Chitwan and Rupandehi.

💬 Local Touch
During harvest, villagers often sing, chat, and share food in the fields—it's a social and joyful time. You might hear phrases like:

“Aloo pakyo!” – The potatoes are ready!

“Sahayog gara na!” – Come help out!
